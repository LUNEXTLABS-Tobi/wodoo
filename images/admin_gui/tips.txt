How to use:

Configuration:

  * RUN_ADMINDEV=1 for debugging in settings
  * ADMIN_PASSWORD=.... - password for user admin
  * ADMIN_BRANCHES_REGEX: provide ; separated list of regexes for branch names:
      e.g.  OV-.*;odoo-.*
	
	By this evil branches are kept away.

Then:

	run /run.sh for updating the container_admin module and start debugging

	run /run.sh dropdb for reset and start debugging

PLEASE WAIT TILL ADMIN INTERFACES STARTET UP: 
  * call htop
  * watch until python odoo is away
